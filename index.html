                    <li>By mid 90's internet was being used more and more </li>
                    <li>People started using it in ways you would expect (anonymity) </li>
                    <li>
                        Society and lawmakers reacted to this the way they always have 
                        <ul>
                            <li>MPAA, Comic Book Code, etc </li>

                    <li>Makes ISPs responsible to make these methods available to customers </li>

                    <li>Made it a crime to knowingly expose minors to obscene material </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The last parts of this law violate not only the First Amendment but, also the vague definition violates the 5th and could lead to self incrimination. </li>
                    <li>In the past proof of age like this only applied to commercial transactions. </li>

                <h2>Threats made on Social Media</h2>
                <h3>Elonis v. United States</h3>
                <h4>In <time datetime="2010">2010</time> Anthony Elonis had some choice words regarding his ex-wife.</h4>

                <blockquote>If I only knew then what I know now . . . I would have smothered your ass with a pillow. Dumped your body in the back seat. Dropped you off in Toad Creek and made it look like a rape and murder.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>Tell [son] he should dress up as Matricide for Halloween.  I don't know what his costume would entail though.  Maybe [ex-wife's] head on a stick? :-p</blockquote>

                <blockquote>There's one way to love ya but a thousand ways to kill ya, <br>
                And I'm not gonna rest until your body is a mess,<br>
                Soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts, <br>
                Hurry up and die bitch so I can bust this nut,<br>
                All over your corpse from atop your shallow grave,<br>
                I used to be a nice guy, then you became a slut,<br>
                I guess it's not your fault you liked your daddy raped you,<br>
                So hurry up and die, bitch, so I can forgive you</blockquote>

                <blockquote>I also found out that it's incredibly illegal, extremely illegal to go on Facebook and say something like the best place to fire a mortar launcher at her house would be from the cornfield behind it because of easy access to a getaway road and you'd have a clear line of sight through the sun room. Yet even more illegal to show an illustrated diagram. </blockquote>

                <blockquote>Fold up your PFA [protection-from-abuse order] <br>
                and put it in your pocket <br>
                Is it thick enough to stop a bullet? <br>
                Try to enforce an Order <br>
                that was improperly granted in the first place <br>
                Me thinks the Judge needs an education on true threat jurisprudence <br>
                And prison time'll add zeros to my settlement <br>
                Which you won't see a lick <br>
                cause you suck dog dick in front of children <br>
                And if worse comes to worse <br>
                I've got enough explosives <br>
                to take care of the State Police and the Sherriff's Department.</blockquote>
                
                <blockquote>That's it, I've had enough <br>
                I'm checking out and making a name for myself <br>
                Enough elementary schools in a ten mile radius to initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined<br>
                And hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a Kindergarten class<br>
                The only question is ... which one?</blockquote>
