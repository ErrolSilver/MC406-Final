                <h2>AOL vs. Kenneth Zeran</h2>

                <p>Kenneth Zeran sued AOL for defamation of a third party and negligence in removing defamatory  statements by one of their users.</p>
                <p>After the Oklahoma City Bombings a post by an anonymous user was made on AOL's website about a t-shirt company that would make shirts with offensive slogans about the bombings. The user then posted Zerans phone number and wrote "ask for Ken" on the posting.
                Zeran was faced with multiple calls by readers of the post when he then called AOL and asked the post be removed. The post was removed, but then the anonymous user posted a similar post with even more offensive t-shirt slogans. Zeran was then repeatedly called and threatened on his life. He alerted AOL again and the FBI.</p>
                <p>A radio station was alerted of the post and told its callers to barrage Zeran with phone calls. It was reported that he was getting phone calls every two minutes. AOL refused to post a statement retracting or even acknowledging the post. Zeran then decided to sue AOL and the radio station.</p>
                <p>The New York Times reported that AOL won the court case and could not be sued based on the fact that they are not responsible for third party information placed onto their website. The following US code protects AOL: http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230.</p>

                <p>The battle with the radio station was also a loss for Zeran. The Times also reported that since Zeran had no proof that he was harmed by the reporting of the post on AOL's website that the radio station did not commit false light invasion of privacy.</p>
                
                <p>According to the United States statute 230, online companies have a lot of leeway when determing information posted on their sites. The information posted by the subscribers and users is not controlled. The site can however delete the information. In AOL's case against Zeran, they refused to keep tabs on a post where they had multiple complaints. It is unfortunate for Zeran that the site got away with being negligent in the governing of their own website. I think that when multiple complaints are made, a site should be responsible to monitor the post.</p>

                <h4>In <time datetime="2010">2010</time> Anthony Elonis had some choice words regarding his ex-wife.</h4>

                <blockquote>If I only knew then what I know now . . . I would have smothered your ass with a pillow. Dumped your body in the back seat. Dropped you off in Toad Creek and made it look like a rape and murder.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>Tell [son] he should dress up as Matricide for Halloween.  I don't know what his costume would entail though.  Maybe [ex-wife's] head on a stick? :-p</blockquote>

                <blockquote>There's one way to love ya but a thousand ways to kill ya, <br>
                And I'm not gonna rest until your body is a mess,<br>
                Soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts, <br>
                Hurry up and die bitch so I can bust this nut,<br>
                All over your corpse from atop your shallow grave,<br>
                I used to be a nice guy, then you became a slut,<br>
                I guess it's not your fault you liked your daddy raped you,<br>
                So hurry up and die, bitch, so I can forgive you</blockquote>

                <blockquote>I also found out that it's incredibly illegal, extremely illegal to go on Facebook and say something like the best place to fire a mortar launcher at her house would be from the cornfield behind it because of easy access to a getaway road and you'd have a clear line of sight through the sun room. Yet even more illegal to show an illustrated diagram. </blockquote>

                <blockquote>Fold up your PFA [protection-from-abuse order] <br>
                and put it in your pocket <br>
                Is it thick enough to stop a bullet? <br>
                Try to enforce an Order <br>
                that was improperly granted in the first place <br>
                Me thinks the Judge needs an education on true threat jurisprudence <br>
                And prison time'll add zeros to my settlement <br>
                Which you won't see a lick <br>
                cause you suck dog dick in front of children <br>
                And if worse comes to worse <br>
                I've got enough explosives <br>
                to take care of the State Police and the Sherriff's Department.</blockquote>
                
                <blockquote>That's it, I've had enough <br>
                I'm checking out and making a name for myself <br>
                Enough elementary schools in a ten mile radius to initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined<br>
                And hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a Kindergarten class<br>
                The only question is ... which one?</blockquote>
